This is a text adventure game built with React and Redux for the view layer and uses an entity component system, nano-ecs.js. It will also store the game data in a local database.

This project is far from complete but a [live version](https://agray5.github.io/Text-Adventure) can be viewed.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
